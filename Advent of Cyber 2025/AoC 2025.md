# Advent of Cyber 2025

This directory contains my writeups for **TryHackMe – Advent of Cyber 2025**.

The focus of these writeups is not only on completing the tasks, but on documenting:
- the approach I followed
- the reasoning behind each step
- observations made during the process
- lessons and concepts reinforced by each challenge

The challenges are guided by design; therefore, these writeups aim to capture understanding rather than trial-and-error problem solving.

---

## Structure

Each day includes:
- the task objective
- tools and commands used
- a step-by-step process
- results and answers
- notes and takeaways

This helps keep the writeups consistent and easy to review later.

---

## Purpose

These writeups are intended to:
- reinforce my understanding of core security concepts
- serve as a personal reference for future labs and CTFs
- demonstrate hands-on learning and practical exposure

They are written primarily for learning and documentation purposes.
